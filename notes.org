** cperl, perl and emacs

In order to use perldoc from Emacs, type ‘M-x cperl-perldoc’, hit Return and
type the keyword to look up. Recommended!

*** Finding Perl modules

As an alternative to the ffap version above, the following will find a given
Perl module, using perl’s internal lookup to find the module:

    (defun perl-module-path (module-name)
      (let* ((file-name
              (concat (replace-regexp-in-string "::" "/" module-name)
                      ".pm"))
             (command-line
              (concat "perl -M'"
                      module-name
                      "' -e'print $INC{q{"
                      file-name
                      "}}'"))
             (path (shell-command-to-string command-line))
             (cant-locate (string-match "^Can't locate " path)))
        (if cant-locate
            nil
          path)))
    (defun find-perl-module (module-name)
      (interactive "sPerl module name: ")
      (let ((path (perl-module-path module-name)))
        (if path
            (find-file path)
          (error "Module '%s' not found" module-name))))
Lisp:perl-find-library.el also provides ‘M-x perl-find-library’, which has the
      same function, but does tab-completion on its input, and uses perldoc -l
      to find the library.
